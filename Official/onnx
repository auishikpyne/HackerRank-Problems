ONNX - Open Neural Network Exchange

1. Initially it was built for deep NN.
2. Mianly support DNN but also allow for traditional ML.
3. ONNX is an open format for ML models, allowing you to interchange models between various ML frameworks and tools.
4. Oftentimes we want these models to be portable so that we can deploy them in environments that might be different than where we initially trained the model.
5. ONNX is designed to allow framework interoporability
